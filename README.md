# CO1212 - Activity
Implement a Java program for Insertion sort, Selection sort, 
Bubble sort, Merge sort, and Quick sort.

# My Implementation 
All those sorting methods are implemented in the 
**me.karunarathne.Sorting** package.  
All these classes implement a similar interface. 
Simply can use the **sort** method of each class.  
`public static void sort (Comparable [] a)`
